<h2>Arrow Rebound</h2>
<h3>Goal/Idea</h3>
<p>A Hypercasual Unity mobile game based heavily on slingshot mechanics
The game brings the fun of Archery and the twist of ricochet together in a 2D space to solve puzzles and clear objectives. Since Each level can be solved in different ways the game becomes rewarding for people who come up with out of the box solutions to solve levels.</p>

<h3>Why It Will Succeed</h3>
<p>The idea is unique, it brings back nostalgia of games like angry birds, and ricochet kills and combines mechanics to provide a fresh experience to the player. The different number of ways each level can be solved encourages everyone to develop their own play style which gives a more personalized experience to the player. The score/star acts as a rewarding system when you are successful in implementing your unique idea of clearing the level.</p>
